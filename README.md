### Hi there 👋

## Usage

I enjoy Ruby, open source, and long walks around the neighborhood 😂

🔭 I’m currently working on a new project called [Demux](https://github.com/lessonly/demux) and trying to build a raspberry PI weather station!

📝 I blog every once in awhile at [reinhardt.io/blog](https://reinhardt.io/blog)

## Installation

You can get in touch through [reinhardt.io](https://reinhardt.io) 👋

## Contributing

LOL, I think I'm starting to wear out the personal README joke.
